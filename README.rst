indicator_scripts
=================

Gtk3 indicator for categorizing and executing scripts easily

Usage
~~~~~

Create a ``.scripts_list`` folder in the user's ``$HOME``. This folder can
include any number of files, plus any subdirectory with arbitrary nesting. The
folder structure will be presented as a tree by the indicator, and any
executable files will be available. In case a file is added or the structure is
changes, the indicator offers a **reload** utility.
